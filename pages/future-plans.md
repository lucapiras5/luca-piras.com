I'm interested in learning more about the following topics:

- The regulations surrounding the *processo civile telematico* (on-line civil trial) in Italy, and whether it's possible to use free and open source software;
- The regulations on information security in Italy and the EU;
- Reverse-engineering, and studying the behavior of executable files;
- Vulnerability scanning and reporting.
