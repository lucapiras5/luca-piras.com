# CV and Certifications

## CV

[**Curriculum vitae**](/static/Piras_Luca_CV.pdf): also includes my contact information.

## Law School

[**Autodichiarazione sostitutiva della laurea con voti degli esami**](static/Dichiarazione_sostitutiva_laurea_voti.pdf) (*Self-signed degree certificate with exam scores*): proves that I've obtained my law degree at the University of Bologna. It contains a list of scores for each exam, and the final score. I obtained the maximum score, **110/110 _cum laude_**.

## Language Certifications

[**Cambridge English, C1 Level**](/static/Cambridge_FCE_C1.pdf): I obtained an A grade on my *Cambridge English: First* test, which translates to C1 on the CEFR scale. See [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240225141216/https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/images/167506-cambridge-english-scale-factsheet.pdf) for details. I'm aiming to obtain a C2 level certificate by the end of 2024.

## Digital Forensics

### 2024

[**Uso del software libero e open source per l'analisi scientifica della prova digitale nell'informatica forense**](/static/informatica-forense/Tesi_Informatica_Forense_2024.pdf)
(*On using free and open source software to scientifically analyze digital evidence in digital forensics*):
my final dissertation. Currently it's only available in Italian, but an English translation is in the works.
The [source files](https://github.com/lucapiras5/tesi-informatica-forense) are available.

The dissertation contains four chapters, which can be summarized as follows:

1. I introduce the legal aspects of digital forensics and digital evidence, and why a *perizia* is the best way to introduce digital evidence in a trial according to the Italian criminal procedure code.

1. I demonstrate that the freedoms and rights provided by free and open source software (as opposed to proprietary and closed source software) best serve the scientific and legal needs of digital forensics.

    Free software facilitates scientific research and peer review, allows for an in-depth cross-examination of expert witnesses, and ultimately results in a judicial decision that is better-informed and well-justified.

    The issues with *captatori informatici* (state-sponsored backdoors installed on mobile devices) demonstrate that <!--From a technical viewpoint, malware has to remain proprietary, closed-source, and hard to reverse-engineer (otherwise, software vendors could easily find the vulnerabilities that it exploits by reading the source code), but this casts doubt on the exact mode of operation of that software. From a legal viewpoint, the law doesn't regulate their use (it only regulates traditional wiretapping of conversations), which means they likely violate art. 15 of the Constitution. But even if their use was to be regulated, it'd be impossible to check if the software complies with said law.--> there's a two-way relationship between using free software and respecting constitutional freedoms within a criminal trial.

1. I discuss how to develop reliable and well-tested software, that carries out repeatable (non-destructive) analyses with reproducibile (test-retest) results, and how to manage open source projects to ensure software quality, security and reliability.

1. I provide various examples of free and open source software that is (or has been) used in criminal investigations. <!-- argue that it's possible to combine various programs through scripts, and improve existing generic programs to suit the needs of a forensic investigator, in addition to using monolithic and specialized software such as Autopsy. -->

Ultimately, I conclude that free and open source software is the ideal model to develop software, and that it has no technical or legal drawbacks. The only factors holding free software back are cultural ones, such as the lack of trust in the model, lack of funding for developers, or lack of adoption by and training for professionals, all of which can be remedied.

The "[*Personal Knowledge*](/personal-knowledge)" section of this website acts as a companion piece to my dissertation and contains a more detailed discussion of its topics, especially in their technical aspects.

### 2020

[**Alcune osservazioni sulla digital evidence &ndash; caratteristiche, ricerca, valutazione**](/static/informatica-forense/Alcune_osservazioni_sulla_digital_evidence_2020.pdf)
(*Some observations on digital evidence &ndash; its characteristics, investigation, evaluation*):
a research paper written while attending the digital forensics course in university.

### 2017

I attended an **introductory practical course on digital forensics** held by [BIT4LAW](https://www.bit4law.com/). The topics it covered are available [here](/static/Corso_BIT4LAW_2017.pdf) in Italian.

### Over the years

I've **attended various seminars** on the subject. Most recently, in 2024 I've attended [this series of seminars](https://web.archive.org/web/20240531001815/https://virtuale.unibo.it/pluginfile.php/2022528/mod_unibores/content/1/Programma%20completo%202024%20con%20CF.pdf):
