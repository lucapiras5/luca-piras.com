There are multiple reasons.  The first is that I've been immersing myself in the language since my early teens.  The overwhelming amount of reading and writing that I do on a daily basis is in English, so it's simply easier for me to continue the trend.

The second reason is that English is the *lingua franca* of anything IT-related, so it's simply easier to write everything in English, than to awkwardly intersperse English expressions all over a foreign language.  Furthermore, by writing in English I can reach a wider audience.

The third reason is that many job listings in Italy require a certain level of competency in English (CEFR B2 at minimum), and as the adage goes, "show, don't tell".  I'm also open to the idea of working abroad, so by using English in the first place I don't have to make a translated version of the website later.

Finally, it'd be inefficient to maintain two versions of the website.  It'd take time and effort to keep the Italian version up-to-date, while it's much more convenient to have a single version.  It's more than likely that anyone who is interested in the subjects I'm writing about already knows English.
